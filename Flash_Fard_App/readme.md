# **Words learning app**
___
> It's a flashcard words learning app with Tkinter GUI:
<br>
<a>The app uses Tkinter GUI to display a card with word on it. After 3 sec. the card "flips" and shows the English translation of the word. If the user guessed the correct translation kliks the checkmark button, if the user does'n know the translation clicks the "x" button.
If the check marck button is pressed the current word is removed from the words to be learned. </a>
<br>
<br>
<a> The app has few validations, and fiew error handlings. Whent the app is closed it saves a scv file with the words who hasen'n been learned yet. When the app is started again it reades from that file. </a>
