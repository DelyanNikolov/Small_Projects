# **Pomodoro app**
___
> simple timer app with Tkinter GUI:
<br>
<a>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. </a>
<br>
<br>
<a> The app uses diferent text colors to display working and brake sessions. And a check mark label to count the completed work sessions. There are 'Start' button to start timing your work, and 'Reset' buuton to set the timer to zero when a new task has to be time managed.
<ul>
  <li>Work time - 25 min.</li>
  <li>Short brake - 5 min.</li>
  <li>Long brake - 20 min.</li>
